# Recursion

This repo was made as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion">The Odin Project: JavaScript course</a> in order to practice what I've learned about recursion.

## Assignment 1: Fibonacci

1. Write a function, "fibs", that uses iteration to take a number and return an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci Sequence. (e.g. fibs(8) should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].)

1. Write another function, "fibsRec", which solves the same problem recursively
